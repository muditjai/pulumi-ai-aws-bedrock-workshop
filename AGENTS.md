# AGENTS.md

**Precedence:** the **closest `AGENTS.md`** to the files you're changing wins. Root holds global defaults only.

## Commands (unverified)
> Source: Makefile — CI-sourced commands are most reliable

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START commands -->
| Task | Command | ~Time |
|------|---------|-------|
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END commands -->

> If commands fail, verify against Makefile/package.json/composer.json or ask user to update.

## Workflow
1. **Before coding**: Read nearest `AGENTS.md` + check Golden Samples for the area you're touching
2. **After each change**: Run the smallest relevant check (lint → typecheck → single test)
3. **Before committing**: Run full test suite if changes affect >2 files or touch shared code
4. **Before claiming done**: Run verification and **show output as evidence** — never say "try again" or "should work now" without proof

## Heuristics (quick decisions)
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START heuristics -->
| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Running tasks | Check `make help` for available commands |
| Adding dependency | Ask first - we minimize deps |
| Unsure about pattern | Check Golden Samples above |
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END heuristics -->

## Repository Settings
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START repo-settings -->
- **Default branch:** `main`
- **Merge strategy:** squash, merge, rebase
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END repo-settings -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START ci-rules -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END ci-rules -->

## Boundaries

### Always Do
- Run pre-commit checks before committing
- Add tests for new code paths
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): subject`
- **Show test output as evidence before claiming work is complete** — never say "try again" or "should work now" without proof
- For upstream dependency fixes: run **full** test suite, not just affected tests

### Ask First
- Adding new dependencies
- Modifying CI/CD configuration
- Changing public API signatures
- Running full e2e test suites
- Repo-wide refactoring or rewrites

### Never Do
- Commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
- Modify vendor/, node_modules/, or generated files
- Push directly to main/master branch
- Delete migration files or schema changes

## Contributing (for AI agents)
- **Comprehension**: Understand the problem before submitting code. Read the linked issue, understand *why* the change is needed, not just *what* to change.
- **Context**: Every PR must explain the trade-offs considered and link to the issue it addresses. Disclose AI assistance if the project requires it.
- **Continuity**: Respond to review feedback. Drive-by PRs without follow-up will be closed.

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START module-boundaries -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END module-boundaries -->

## Codebase State
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START codebase-state -->

- Contains deprecated code (grep for @deprecated)
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END codebase-state -->

## Scoped AGENTS.md (MUST read when working in these directories)
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START scope-index -->
- (No scoped AGENTS.md files yet)
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END scope-index -->

> **Agents**: When you read or edit files in a listed directory, you **must** load its AGENTS.md first. It contains directory-specific conventions that override this root file.

## When instructions conflict
The nearest `AGENTS.md` wins. Explicit user prompts override files.
